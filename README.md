# KERNEL-METHODS
Kaggle Data Challenge project for course: Machine learning with kernel methods-MASH,MVA(J-P Vert,M Arbel)




# Graph Classification:

### Graph Set Reconstruction

Removing the frequent least discriminant subgraphs while keeping the most discriminant frequent subgraphs using gSPAN algorithm.

Run Reconstruct.py

### Compute kernel 

Computing the Weisfeiler-Lehman Kernel matrix with Computekernel.py  on the Reconstructed Training set and the test set


### Feature reduction

Reducing the dimensionality of the Kernel matrix using KernelFDA and RBF kernel 

### Classification 

Performing classification using Kernel Support Vector machine

Run Classification.py
