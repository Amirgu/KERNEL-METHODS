Graph classification Kaggle Challenge :https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/data-challenge-kernel-methods-2022-2023



# Graph Classification:

### Graph Set Reconstruction

Removing the frequent least discriminant subgraphs while keeping the most discriminant frequent subgraphs using gSPAN algorithm.

Run Reconstruct.py

### Compute kernel 

Computing the Weisfeiler-Lehman Kernel matrix with Computekernel.py  on the Reconstructed Training set and the test set


### Feature reduction

Reducing the dimensionality of the Kernel matrix using KernelFDA and RBF kernel 

### Classification 

Performing classification using Kernel Support Vector machine

Run Classification.py
